This is my attempt to automate some of my work as a publisher & head of backoffice at republicmag.io (former republic.ru)

My goal is to build a simple and reliable determenistic + AI agentic setup that would do the most tasks for me.

The code written here should be clean & minimalistic - only do what it has to do. No extreme safety-checks or potential feature stubs.
Every implemented feature should work 100% and should not do anything outside of its scope. 

As for now, there are two core parts: telegram bot and backend. Telegram bot acts as an interface for me and other people that need me. Backend has the core functionality. They are currently tightly coupled and that is fine.
